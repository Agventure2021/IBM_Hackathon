Introduction
Our objective is to develop a solution which can reduce hunger issues and can lead the world towards no hunger,to focus on the proper food distribution with least cost and time,to work on digitization of co-operatives to reduce logistical challenges and to collect the crop data and store it for gaining insights in future.
To overcome this problem here three major concerns are aimed:

1.To make efficient arrangements for crop sell (Availability).
2.Preventing black marketing and unfair selling.
3.To avail the items as per requirements of person and his/her family.

Solution
we are proposing a single web/telephonic platform for all farmers and co-operatives to sell and buy their crops at the right time to the right place efficiently.
It will contain two modules majorly:

For producers mainly farmers to get a proper path to sell their product/crop.
For co-operatives to get materials directly from producers and to work on digitization of co-operatives to reduce logistical challenges.
